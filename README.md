# House Price Prediction Model
This repository features a basic model for estimating property values, developed with Python. The project follows a methodical approach, including data preprocessing, model creation using a regularized linear regression technique, and the development of a web interface for user interaction.

Core Components

Data Preparation: The model employs a dataset from a popular source (Seattle House Price Dataset). The dataset is processed to manage missing entries, categorical information, and other necessary cleaning tasks.

Model Creation: The machine learning model is built using a regularized linear regression technique (Ridge regression) with the help of the scikit-learn library. The finalized model is stored for future use.

Web Interface: The project includes a Flask-based web application, offering a simple interface for estimating property values. Users can input characteristics such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, property size, and location to get an estimated value.

Usage:

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask application:


python main.py

Open your web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the House Price Prediction interface.
